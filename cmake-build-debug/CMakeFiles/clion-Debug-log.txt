CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:6 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findtoml11.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "toml11", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "toml11" with any
  of the following names:

    toml11Config.cmake
    toml11-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "toml11" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "toml11_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "toml11"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
